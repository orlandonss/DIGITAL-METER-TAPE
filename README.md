# DIGITAL-METER-TAPE
I made a digital tape measure in 2023, as a project to finish my high school whit arduino and a 3d box model.
A friend from Netherlands also was involved in this project, we worked at distance having some brainstorming in 
what kind of project to do, as a final project from highschool involving hardware and software.
We are glad to share the project we made together.
The Report is only available in Portuguese, but the files from the project such  as the source code are all available
in english.
